                                creating intuitive and effective user interfaces. Students will learn user-centered
                                design principles, user research methods, rapid prototyping, usability testing, and
                                visual design techniques. In addition, they will acquire skills in popular interaction
                                design tools, such as Adobe XD, Sketch or Figma.

                                which refers to the organization and structure of information in software systems. You
                                will learn how to create navigation schematics, taxonomies, site maps, and information
                                flow diagrams. Advanced interaction design techniques such as content-driven design and
                                user experience personalization will also be explored.

                                focus. Students will learn to apply more advanced user research techniques such as
                                in-depth interviews, remote usability testing, and task analysis. You will also delve
                                into user-centered design theory, including concepts such as cognitive ergonomics,
                                emotional usability, and inclusive design.
